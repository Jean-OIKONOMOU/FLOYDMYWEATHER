# FLOYD MYWEATHER

This isn't my first rodeo with VUE.js ! But, it is the biggest project I've done with **VUE.js** as of yet...
I've had to fix the **"mixed network request"** error by changing all the HTTP in my dist into HTTPS.
I also had to fix, with the help of **Jean-Marc BROUTIN**, the holy, the mistyped href links in my index.html. They were created without the **dot** in front of the **slash**, I could fix that by taking all the files out of the dist folders and putting them at the root of my project, this way I won't need to put **/dist/** in front of my Github Page URL. I don't feel comfortable doing that though.
Here's the link to the [website](https://jean-oikonomou.github.io/FLOYDMYWEATHER/dist/#).

# FIGMA

Here's the link to my [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MUSukZoNaNOy8YAq28198SkW/OpenWeatherMap?node-id=0%3A1). The final product does not look **at all** like my first thought of this project!.

# Contributors

[**Cédric VAN HOVE**](https://github.com/cevaho) contributed greatly to my project. Even though we each decided to make our own Weather App, which explains why you're getting two different weather apps from the both of us, we helped each other A LOT. We just really wanted to make our own, unique, weather app. **Jean-Marc BROUTIN** helped me a lot during the Github Page phase. I also helped other people a lot, and I hope they'll mention me sometime **:'(**
